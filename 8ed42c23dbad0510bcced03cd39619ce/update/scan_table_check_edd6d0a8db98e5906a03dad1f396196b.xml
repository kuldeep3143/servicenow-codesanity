        <description>A class is usually representing either a real-life object, a connection between different things, an interface or a capability. Sometimes however, classes end up being just a bucket with all sorts of different things - that do not necessarily belong together.  Sometimes these classes have names that end with "Utils". Such a design should be avoided. Each class should have a distinct and clearly identifiable (and understandable) scope. The fact that the features or methods in a class were created by one person or a team or during a specific project do usually not justify packing them together. Features should be distributed into different classes (or functions) in a way that makes sense. </description>

        <resolution_details>Refactor the code in a way to split the contained methods into separate classes or individual functions until these classes and functions have clearly understandable names that indicate what the class or function does or represents. Rename classes so that their name does not contain "Utils" - however do not "just" rename the class to avoid non-compliance. Do the hard work of refactoring the code to help others to better understand and navigate it.</resolution_details>
